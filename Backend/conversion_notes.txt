My goal is to have a system where, with two DC motors attaced, a user will feel as if they're driving a normal car (i.e. the motors are in sync in terms forward or backward)
Behaviors of this are...
a.) both motors are always spinning in the same direction
b.) while turning, one motor will spin less than the other
c.) so that full forward, will be both motors wide open
d.) full either left or right will be only the opposing motor on, so as to pivot on it's inside wheel
	-turning right means the right motor is off, and the left motor is full on, and vice versa
