- The ping sent out on the ng app's startup can be recieved and relayed
by the python webserver to the raspberry pi. Next up is work in the frontend, to make it so that a button can be used to send out the message to be relayed to trigger actions on the pi.

- Frontend:
	Added buttons to send specific commands to the server
	Having an issue where the socket is always in the 'CONNECTING' state

- Server:
	Switched from SocketService, to TCPServer after finding out that python has a built in socketserver library
	Need to work on dealing with the raspberrypi's IP(Assigning it a static IP or having a way of keeping it updated.)
