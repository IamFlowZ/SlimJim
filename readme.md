<h1> This is SlimJim </h1>
Similar to his cousin, the FatMan, SlimJim is here to serve all your small scale needs.
The frontend connects the middle man, which somehow finds its way to a raspberry pi of your choice.
Hook up some wheels, a couple servos and motors, maybe even a camera, and your on your way to having your very own, 100% secure, 100% legitmate, 100% remote, remote-control car. _Software is as is, i'll help where I can, but no gurantees *shrug*_
